## Hey there, welcome to my blog!

I'm Raphael a web developer from Austria. I'm interested in anything web dev
and computer science related. I'm all about keeping things simple, that's why
my current tech stack includes Go SSR, no build JS with import maps and HTMX.
Alogirithms, data structures, networking and anything else programming related
is cool too I guess! Might post about any of these topics, might not, lets see...
