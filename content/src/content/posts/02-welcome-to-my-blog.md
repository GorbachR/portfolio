## Hey there, welcome to my blog!

I'm Raphael a web developer from Austria. On this blog I plan to talk about
anything web and programming related. Right now my focus is mostly on frontend
UI frameworks like React and Angular, backend dev with mostly Go and more
generally computer science basics like data structures, algorithms, software design
and networking.

## The complexity of Web Development

Web development really isn't easy, not because the individual steps involved
are necessarily particularly intellectually challenging, but because the sheer
amount of steps involved. Building out UIs with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** and 
knowing **browser APIs**, handling the backend with **middleware** for **logging** 
and **auth** also dealing with **database** access. Knowing the ins and outs of software design
and programming in general. Being able to recognize patterns in problems to
apply the proper **algorithm**. Version management with **git**. Networking so you know
how to deploy your servers etc...

In this web of complexity I want to add some clarity with this blog. Some posts
will focus on distinct problems we all may encounter, maybe an opinion piece here 
or there, others will be reviews of books I have finished recently. I'm not expecting
a big audience, however I hope I can help some people become better software engineers.
